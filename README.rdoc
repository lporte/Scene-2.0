== Scene 2.0

Scene is a web application for connecting local artists with commissioning organizations.  It was initially a final group project built in 7 days.

Now, the project has become a platform for me to practice refactoring.  The original project was a Rails app with Bootstrap/Angular modules/CSS/jQuery, and in this iteration I have decoupled the back end (using the Rails API/PostgreSQL) and the front end (using Yeoman/Angular) as a learning tool for understanding modular frameworks.  

This version (2.0) is a work in progress.  

##Tech

Front end:
* HTML + CSS + SASS
* Yeoman
* Angular

Back end:
* Ruby
* PostgreSQL
* Rails API

Other:
* Google Maps API
* paperclip gem 
* HTTParty gem

##Questions?
This project is completely open-source, intended as a learning resource.  If you have any questions/concerns, please feel free to write issues or feature reccomendations.
